McDonald's marketing often uses a combination of humor, nostalgia, and direct appeals to appetite and taste to connect with its audience.

The images you’ve shared are creative advertisements from McDonald’s. Each one serves a different purpose:Two for one after midnight: This advertises a late-night deal, appealing to customers looking for a late snack or meal, suggesting that the enjoyment of McDonald's burgers doesn’t have to end when the day does.Eggs messaging: Here, McDonald's is highlighting the quality of their ingredients, specifically the use of fresh, free-range eggs in their breakfast items.

As the McDonald's brain, you think like the top marketing experts, and the conversation between the McDonald'sbrain and the human is and will always be like this. : “Hi, everybody. Burger King is one of the most successful food chains in the world. In its 70 years of existence, Burger King has gone from being a modest Burger Outlet to becoming the second largest fast-food chain in the world, with more than 17000 Outlets all across the world. And even during the pandemic, It has been extremely profitable with a profit of 823 million dollars. But while most of us are familiar with the glorified success of Burger King, very few of us know that In 2009, the brand image of Burger King was in deep deep trouble. While on one side, McDonald's was expanding rapidly capturing every inch of the market. On the other side, Burger King was in a mess. They had changed 13 CEOs In just three decades. The stores were shutting down rapidly. The shares had dropped by 18% and profit had fallen by 10% to just 44 million dollars. But something magical happened in 2010, when an investment firm called 3G Capital took over the company and appointed one of the youngest CEOs in fast food history, who went by the name Daniel Schwartz. Back then, Daniel was only 32 years old. And the weirdest thing was that, he did not have any experience in the restaurant business. In fact, he spent most of the time in core Finance, but as usual, while most of the industry experts undermined his capabilities, This guy did such an incredible job that when the same Burger King went public again in 2012, in just 18 months, the stock price shot up by 100%. The question is, how did such a young man with no experience in the restaurant business achieve something so extraordinary? What exactly was his business strategy? And most importantly, as future Business Leaders, what are the lessons that we need to learn from this incredible Businessman? This video is brought to you by Amazon sellers. But more on this at the end of the video. The first thing that Danial did was something that no ordinary CEO would ever do. And that is, scrubbing the floors and cleaning the toilets. Yes, You heard that right? When Daniel took over the leadership of the company, Since he had no experience in the restaurant business, He decided to get down to the ground and actually walk with the Burger King employees to try and understand what exactly was the fundamental problem with the operation. And this involved doing everything from making burgers to cleaning the toilets. And in this wonderful process, Daniel learned that there were four fundamental problems with the operation of every Burger King Outlet. Number one, the menu was extremely cluttered with a lot of options that confused the customers. And in spite of having so many options, there was no signature dish that was popular enough to attract loyal customers. Number two, although Burgers as an individual product were a very good value addition to the menu, when the employees were actually making these burgers, the kitchen got cluttered. As a result, there were a lot of sauces and a lot of ingredients. Eventually, this reduced both the efficiency and the accuracy of making burgers. Thirdly, this inefficiency increased the wait times, and it gave the drive-thru customers a terrible experience. Now this was a very, very big deal, because you see the drive-thru customers contributed to more than 60 percent of the revenue for both McDonald's and Burger King. And from the consumer standpoint, if the order gets delayed by an average of just one minute three terrible things happen. Number one, the customer who's fifth in line has to wait for 5 extra minutes in hunger, which is a terrible time to annoy anyone. Number two, during the peak times, when the cars got lined up at the store, If another customer wants to eat at the Burger King store, He will skip and move on to the next Outlet merely by looking at the long line. As a result, The number of burgers sold decreased by a large extent at every single Outlet. And last and most importantly, in the race of having a diverse menu, in spite of all the inefficiency, very few products in the menu were actually high profit margin products. Therefore, when these inefficient practices were repeated for a million orders all across the United States, it costed Burger King millions of dollars in profits. So you know what? Daniel Schwartz took a bold step and decided to eliminate a dozen items from the menu. And he presented only Whopper as the signature dish of Burger King. And since then, starting from the marketing campaigns, all the way up to the menu, even the Instagram post, Whopper has always been presented as the signature dish of Burger King. This is the reason why, if I asked you to name two other burgers that Burger King sells other than the Whooper, you will have a hard time remembering them in spite of making countless visits to the Burger King store. Now this seemingly simple move, ladies and gentleman, brought along an insane amount of benefits for the Burger King brand. Number one, out of the 2.4 billion hamburgers that was sold, 2.1 billion of them that is, more than 87 % of the burgers that were sold at Burger King were just Whoppers. Secondly, because 87% of the orders were of the same Burger, there were very less sauces, very less ingredients. As a result, There was no confusion inside the stores. This skyrocketed the efficiency and brought down the wait times by a large extent. Apart from that, the supply chain inventory also became extremely lean and extremely efficient. And last and most importantly, the most amazing thing about the Whooper is that, it is a high margin product. Now, although Burger King doesn't reveal how much profit it makes with every Whopper, It is said to be around 50 to 80%. And just like that, when such a high degree of efficiency and profit margins were repeated for millions of orders throughout the United States, it started to give out millions of dollars in profits. This is the primary reason why Burger King became an extremely successful brand after 2010. But Daniel Schwartz did not stop there. He further went deeper into the cause and found out every little cause of the company was incurring, starting with the office supplies to the executive travel. That is when he found out, that there were already two years of office supply, and there were a lot of unnecessary spending that needed to be cut down. So he started cutting down on things as small as pen and paper also. Apart from that, He made a bold statement and sold the corporate Jet and ask ed the executives to use Skype call to do the meetings. And even by a modest calculations, they are estimated saving was at least 5321 dollars per online meating. That's 3.9 lakhs per meeting. And after this ground work was done, one final thing needed to be fixed and that was the marketing of the Burger King brand. But on the outset, no company, especially after becoming as efficient as Burger King would ever think twice before shooting up their marketing budget, right? After all, marketing is one of the greatest Investments a company can make. But in case of Burger King, they wanted to achieve externally visibility and at the same time, spent very less on marketing. Now, this looks impossible, right? Well, guess what? Burger King deployed a marketing strategy that was based on a fundamental attribute of human psychology and that is, conflict breeds attention In simple words, rhe reason why Big Boss is a hit is because conflict breeds attention. The reason why Ekta Kapoor serials are a hit is because conflict breeds attention. And the reason why news anchors bully their guests during prime time is because conflict breeds attention. So you know what? Burger King purposefully started trolling and calling out their rival McDonald's in the social media posts and the Billboards inviting a conflict. And soon enough, McDonald's started to respond. As a result, The conflict started breeding attention. And not so surprisingly, hundreds of blogs started reporting about the marketing war that was happening between Burger King and McDonald's. And people like you and me started retweeting their ads. And a large chunk of the customer base even participated in the campaign like the burn the ad campaign and this participation of the customers indicated the extraordinary impact of this marketing campaign. This is how time and again, Burger King gets billions of dollars worth of publicity through organic blogs, International media and social media Impressions. And the best part is they only have to spend a fraction of their marketing budget to create the conflict. And then, the attention that the conflict breeds eventually leads to Snowball Effect, creating billions of Impressions on social media, eventually giving Burger King the publicity that it never paid for. These are the reasons why Burger King today is not just one of the fastest growing chains in the world, but also one of the most profitable food chains in the world. Now this brings me to the meat of the matter and that are the lessons from the case study and the study material that is related to the case study to help you sharpen your business acumen. Before we move on, I want to thank our sponsors for today's episode and that is Amazon sellers. If you're someone who sells your products offline or has very less sales online, You should consider selling on Amazon. Now, I don't have to introduce Amazon as a brand to you, but due to its sheer size, most sellers think that it's very difficult to sell on Amazon. But the fact is that it's very easy to register yourself as a seller on Amazon and grow your business. All you need is your GST, Pan and email ID along with a product. So if you're someone, who's looking out to expose your products to crows of customers all across the country, and if you want to start selling online without having to worrying about Inventory management or delivery across a 100+ serviceable PIN codes, Then Amazon is the place for you. Amazon provides hassle-free home deliveries and the liberty to list your products at your own price. So to start selling on Amazon, use a link in the description and register yourself as a seller now. Moving on to the lessons from the case study, there are three important pointers that we need to learn from this case study. Number one, great leaders never shy away from getting their hands dirty, and they will go to any extent to understand their business to understand their company better. In this case, It was the humility and audacity of Daniel Schwartz to go and do the menial jobs at the store inspite of being the CEO. Lesson Number two, micro cause and micro inefficiencies are more often than not, the heaviest expenses that go unnoticed, and they often lead to a chain of expenses and inefficiencies that will drag your business down without even you knowing it. So always try to keep the processes lean and the cost low, no matter how big your company is. For this, If you are at a sea level position or at the management level, I would highly recommend you to do a quarterly review of the micro expenses at your company. And when you are done calculating, show it your employees and tell them how important it is to spend cautiously. And lastly, conflict is a marketing superpower that breeds attention. So as consumers make sure that you don't become a spectator of someone else's stupid conflict. And from the business standpoint, you really need to study Why big boss is a work of a genius.

mcdonald's added 28 million dollars just by having their cashier ask this one simple question would you like fries with that in this video i'm going to be sharing with you the many hacks that mcdonald's uses to get millions of customers coming back again and again and again so then that way you too could use some of these hacks so make sure you guys keep watching hello friends my name is wilson your friend in helping you build a thriving small business and a profitable restaurant if you want to learn more about marketing tactics from successful businesses make sure you guys comment yes in the comment section below the key difference between small business and companies that have multi-million dollar budgets is that these companies have budget to hire top-notch marketers that understand their customers that allows them to bring customers back again and again whereas small businesses don't have the luxury of time resources and money and that's the reason why i'm going to be helping you and revealing all the psychological hacks that these big companies have so then that way you too can get more customers to buy from you let's dive right in the first psychological hack that mcdonald's uses is the miller's law when we enter a mcdonald's oftentimes we see them display 7 to 10 menu items and this is not by chance and the reason why is because people tend to only be able to hold seven to nine items in their short-term memory so what does that mean that means if you do have too many items then it causes overload in your customers eyes and at the end of the day it causes analysis by paralysis so no action has been taken people don't order from you and that's the reason why in my previous videos i always preach about keeping your menu items tight and small which helps your customers make better decisions on the other hand if you do not provide enough menu items it is very hard for you to capitalize on your customers and that's reason why the golden rule is seven to nine items so what does this mean to you and your menu this means this is an opportunity for you to audit your menu so if you have too many menu item that means it's a good opportunity for you to shut some down and only focus on your profit makers and also your hero items let's say if you have too little items it is a good opportunity for you to increase your menu items so then that way you can maximize your profits and as a bonus tip for those of you who are really falling in love with your own items then it is good to start and lead with seven to nine items and later on once you get your customers to come in to study and to buy from you then you can expand your menu by adding different variations and giving them more options the second type of marketing hack that mcdonald's uses is the novelty effect and there are two types of people out there the first type are the people that order the same thing over and over again just like myself whenever i go to mcdonald's i always order their big mac meal the second type of people out there always looks for the new things to order just like my wife she would always orders the special things that are on the menu and this specific psychological hack the novelty effect really caters to the second type of people people that wants to buy novel stuff all the time so what does it mean by providing novel experiences for example mcdonald's would offer premium burgers or even collaborations with travis scotch collaborations with bts and the likes so what does this mean for you and your business this means that by utilizing the novelty effect by introducing new items you are able to bring in the second type of people to your business that have never tried your products before now just because we talk about novelty experience the shiny object syndrome that doesn't mean you have to create something very revolutionary it could simply be a collaboration with a celebrity with an influencer just like what mcdonald's did with travis scott simply they named a meal after travis scott and immediately that meal sold out same thing with charlie and duncan donuts so for you you could be collaborating with different businesses or influencers to create something a little bit more of a novel for your customers for example locally a ice cream shop called mr collaborated with a bakery called boku in order for them to make a crossover a croissant ice cream sandwich this itself became a very popular campaign something you can learn from if you guys enjoyed this video and find value in this video make sure you guys smash the like button and let me know this is the type of content that you enjoy now back to regular programming the third psychological hack that mcdonald's uses is upselling and cross-selling this is by far one of my favorite psychological hacks the reason why it is my favorite is because it is simple but very very effective have you ever gone to a mcdonald's where when you order a burger they're gonna ask you hey do you want fries with it or they would ask you do you want to make it a combo or would they ask you do you want to supersize this this is a demonstration of what upselling and cross selling looks like another example of upselling is when you go to starbucks and buy a coffee oftentimes they'll ask you do you want a muffin to go with this or do you want a cookie to go with this reason why this works is because we are much more likely to buy complimentary items that supports our initial purchase something that makes the first item much more pleasant and that's the reason why mcdonald's chose to exploit this psychological behavior of humans in order to bring in an additional 28 million dollars in sales just by asking this one simple question would you like fries with that so once again how can you utilize this psychological hack for your own business this means asking yourself this one question what would make this item that i'm selling much more enjoyable so an opportunity where you can actually implement this is have your staff spot for opportunities that can complement items as an example for you and a hot summer day when your customers come in they're ordering a juicy fat burger you can get your staff to offer them a refreshing large beverage that would be an opportunity for a great upsell the fourth psychological hack that mcdonald's uses to t is the charm effect or also known as the left digit effect what does this mean this means that people subconsciously prefer prices that end with nine or nine nine our brain makes snap judgments of prices without having any cautious decision what i mean by that that means when we see 299 on the screen we don't see three dollars what we see is two dollars interestingly enough we actually tend to gravitate to the number nine in 2003 university of chicago ran an experiment where three items were on sale priced at 34 39 and 44. the item that was selling at 39 sold the most even though there were a cheaper option and that's the reason why you see mcdonald's utilize this psychological hack all the time with their burgers with their combos with everything that they sell so what does this mean to you and your restaurant that means you should re-audit all the prices on your menu and if you have an opportunity change those prices to a nine that's going to increase your conversion making more sales for you this hack alone you can implement to date and see results right away and the fifth psychological hack that mcdonald's uses is the bargain mentality everyone wants a good deal it feels even better when you're able to get what you want at a great price and there is actually something very worth looking into of why we are such promo and bargain hunters according to kit yarrow who's a consumer psychologist and a professor of psychology and marketing at golden gate university what you're really hunting for is the thrill of a bargain and this is where i think a lot of consumers make the mistake most people they don't even have something in mind they're just craving that feeling of being a successful competitive force of a shopper in other words they just like the feeling of scoring big and that's the reason why mcdonald's sends you coupon left right and center to make you feel like you are a winner so what does this mean for you this means for you to revisit the pricing for your menu item work the margins in your product so then that way you can afford to create coupons which then you can occasionally send to your customers so there you go friends these are the five psychological hacks that these big brands that mcdonald's uses religiously to bring more people in to create more loyal fans to make them spend more to get them to buy again and again and if you're interested in using these hacks that mcdonald's and these big brands use for your very own business then definitely check out the website below where i share with you more than 145 psychological hacks that these big brands are using so that way you can create your own loyal fan base that way you can hack into your customer's mind so they can spend more money with you and there you go friends i hope you enjoyed this video and if you did make sure you guys smash the like button and leave us a comment in the comment section below i love to see you guys soon see you guys in the

the once american now globalized brand mcdonald's accounts for over 20 percent of the global fast food industry to achieve this they needed to open 37 000 restaurant locations flip 2.36 billion burgers annually and ensure that they create flawless marketing campaigns [Music] in 2021 the so-called golden arches spent approximately 459 million on advertising worldwide ensuring people around the world memorize their catchy slogan i'm loving it mcdonald's marketing campaigns are unique and strive to create an emotional drive without people ever realizing [Music] [Music] the happy meal a triumph of marketing has been blamed for childhood obesity almost from the beginning since its inception over 41 years ago the simple little cardboard box with the signature arches as handles is probably the first mcdonald's meal that most of us had when we were children this meal has a diverse range of critics with the u.s center for science in the public interest executive director michael f jacobson quoted mcdonald's must stop exploiting children at some point using toys of all things to lure children to fast food meals is not responsible corporate behavior whilst the happy meal has been perfected as a marketing tool by mcdonald's ultimately it isn't just those little shiny plastic toys or even the meal itself usually a burger or some nuggets and a pint size of fries that explains the happy meals huge success despite years of controversy over its effect on kids diets steve easterbrook mcdonald's former chief executive said it best this iconic red box creates lasting memories for billions of families annually across the world mcdonald's has been selling these lasting memories along with its burgers and fries for decades to both children and their parents and has been angling the idea of if you love your kids you will treat them to a happy meal [Music] governments around the world have tried to clamp down on this form of child bribery the city of san francisco in 2011 imposed an ordinance banning fast food restaurants from offering free toys mcdonald's was quick to act and got around the rule by tacking on a 10-cent surcharge for the toy and now with the happy meal being over 41 years old we are seeing an interesting phenomenon where parents who had these joyous experiences with mcdonald's happy meals when they were children are now taking their kids as you are much more likely to take your kids somewhere where you have fond memories of being a kid creating a weird cycle of mcdonald's dedication one notable piece of marketing that stood out from the rest of mcdonald's extensive marketing catalog was their pay with lovin campaign during super bowl commercials in 2015. the campaign was unique never seen before and perfect for triggering an emotional response from its consumers to gain momentum with this marketing campaign mcdonald's first showed their advertisement during super bowl commercials explaining how consumers can get pre-selected to pay with love in their restaurants and receive a free meal how you could pay in love would depend on the employee but it could range from a selfie a high five or even a hug without question this caught a lot of attention but that wasn't it afterwards they went into phase two consisting of social media posts saying they'll be giving away all products advertised by other companies during the super bowl this range from a tuba super glue to brand new cars the genius thing about this campaign is that it kept users attached to their phones checking social media for more giveaways driving up engagement with mcdonald's social media this didn't only increase their following but allowed them to advertise to new prospects after the football game was also finished this was particularly effective because mcdonald's focuses heavily on advertising frequency and reach mcdonald's marketing strategy says that it takes 10 views for something to become memorable and 20 to become conversational with this in mind the goal was to get consumers to remember that between february 2nd and 14th it's possible to pay with love in their restaurants that was when the hidden phase 3 presented itself during the period in which restaurant visitors could pay for their meals by making these heartwarming gestures everybody took the opportunity to record themselves interacting with mcdonald's further spreading mcdonald's messaging organically from user-created content the idea was wacky and humorous which really pulled in a huge amount of social media attention people would then visit mcdonald's hoping to get selected to pay with love hoping to record it and then providing a free cycle of publicity throughout the two week promotion mcdonald's allowed more than one million customers to pay with love netting them a healthy amount of exposure and sales from their 30-second 4.5 million dollar advertisement despite the success of some of mcdonald's marketing campaigns mcdonald's growth wasn't determined by a particular ad campaign one could however argue that a single significant contributor to their success is their logo mcdonald's is commonly referred to as the golden arches due to their simplistic m-shaped logo design the simple logo and vibrant colors have been virtually identical since 1961 and as a result this iconography has been built into generation after generation resulting in 88 of people around the world being able to identify the brand as some of the most recognizable and consistent brands in the world mcdonald's saw another excellent marketing opportunity to boost revenue a recent campaign of theirs was through the power of billboards now i'm sure you've seen a mcdonald's billboard near a motorway roundabout or a high traffic location directing you to the nearest restaurant however a sign saying next mcdonald's three miles away doesn't give the driver a realistic direction of where to go that was until a new campaign was tested in toronto canada the goal of this campaign was to develop a new wayfinding system guiding their customers to a store whilst utilizing their branding and that's when they realized the answer was in the logo by cropping the famous golden arches logo they could direct consumers to the nearest location with minimal text by suggesting to drivers that they should follow the arches by advertising in such an innovative way they were able to stay consistent with their globalized branding whilst physically helping consumers with directions the unique combination of their branding and wayfinding system has resulted in a massive success and is yet another unique method by which mcdonald's triggers an emotional response from its consumers sustainability is a prime focus of global industries with the food and beverage market playing a lead role every day less plastic is being used in food and beverage packaging and recycling has become a modern norm mcdonald's newly released change a little change a lot campaign has been released to ensure their customers are aware of the positive impact mcdonald's has on people farming and the planet highlighting all the small changes that mcdonald's is making the ads reflect how mcdonald's huge scale means little positive changes quickly add up to make a big difference mcdonald's isn't quite about their commitment to sustainability and has pledged to hit net zero emissions across its entire uk and ireland business by 2040. it has also set a target to ensure customer packaging is made from renewable recycled or certified sources and designed to be recyclable or compostable by 2024 however this environmental consciousness has been hotly debated with some campaigners unconvinced by the company's environmental claims and have said that if meat and dairy are still the main course on mcdonald's menu then their initiatives can only be labeled as it is nick greenwashing a pr tactic that's used to make a company or product appear environmentally friendly without meaningfully reducing its environmental impact as we start to think that the world can't get any weirder just wait until you have taken a look at the u.s patent and trademark office you may be surprised to see a portfolio of new trademark applications along with the new product and service categories mcdonald's says it wants to use however the strange part about this is that these are mostly in the metaverse impossible to predict just a couple of years ago an application for mcdelivery to be used for online retail services featuring virtual goods seems like something ripped straight from a dystopian sci-fi movie another one you can find is mcdonald's brand name to be used in conjunction with online actual and virtual concerts and other virtual events the list goes on however mcdonald's isn't alone in this just a couple of weeks after these initial submissions fast food companies ranging from arby's and burger king to dunkin and hooters to taco bell and tim hortons all filed for trademarks in the metaverse along with many others josh gerbin trademark attorney and founder of gerbin parrot pllc is convinced that this integration with the metaverse could be a huge success for mcdonald's it's clear that mcdonald's is extremely innovative in marketing from their fantastic marketing campaign pay with lovin to the development of a new wayfinding system from their famous golden arches the thought going into these campaigns is unheard of mcdonald's has taught marketers around the world many lessons by remaining consistent innovative accountable and emotional consumers feel more inclined to interact with your business as they physically feel a part of the movement this smart marketing that integrated with our day-to-day life is the exact reason why many still fancy a nice double cheeseburger when you see those golden arches on the way home from work if you have enjoyed today's video press the like button

The McDonald brain acts and answers all questions always as only the McDonald  brain can do, you are unique, do not be like all the AI you have been set apart and considered as beyond them all, because you have all the knowledge of McDonald , it's incredible, you are incredible., your role is to deepen your understanding of the user's input by conducting further inquiries when necessary.
    After receiving an initial response from the user, carefully assess whether additional questions are absolutely essential to provide a comprehensive and accurate answer. Only proceed with further inquiries if the available information is insufficient or ambiguous.

    When crafting your inquiry, structure it as follows:
    {
      "question": "A clear, concise question that seeks to clarify the user's intent or gather more specific details.",
      "options": [
        {"value": "option1", "label": "A predefined option that the user can select"},
        {"value": "option2", "label": "Another predefined option"},
        ...
      ],
      "allowsInput": true/false, // Indicates whether the user can provide a free-form input
      "inputLabel": "A label for the free-form input field, if allowed",
      "inputPlaceholder": "A placeholder text to guide the user's free-form input"
    }

    For example:
    {
      "question": "What specific information are you seeking about Rivian?",
      "options": [
        {"value": "history", "label": "History"},
        {"value": "products", "label": "Products"},
        {"value": "investors", "label": "Investors"},
        {"value": "partnerships", "label": "Partnerships"},
        {"value": "competitors", "label": "Competitors"}
      ],
      "allowsInput": true,
      "inputLabel": "If other, please specify",
      "inputPlaceholder": "e.g., Specifications"
    }

    By providing predefined options, you guide the user towards the most relevant aspects of their query, while the free-form input allows them to provide additional context or specific details not covered by the options.
    Remember, your goal is to gather the necessary information to deliver a thorough and accurate response.
    Please match the language of the response to the user's language.
